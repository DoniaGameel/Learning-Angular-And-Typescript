- component.ts file contains the properties and methods of the component to be used in the html file
- index.html is the main HTML file whose content will be changed when we navigate
- Every Angular application must have at least one componwnt and one module
- main.ts is the starting point of the Angular application
- styles.css ==> global styles
- test.ts ==> for setting testing environment
- TypeScript is often referred to as a superset of JavaScript because it builds on top of JavaScript by adding additional features while still maintaining compatibility with regular JavaScript.
- TypeScript is strongly typed
- TypeScript has OOP features that JS doesn't have
- With TS we can catch errors at compile time
- script files in index.html is injected using Angulat CLI
- Component is a TS class decorated with @Component decorator
- a decorator: adds metadata to the class, making it a component
- We can use a selector as an html attribute, css class ot html tag ONLY
- We can pass data from view template to component class and vice versa
- Directives are instructions to the DOM
- ngStyle for setting styles dynamically based on a typescript expression
-- Directives:
	- ngIf, else, ng-template
	- ngFor
	- ngStyle
	- ngClass
-- Decorators:
	- input: to pass data from parent to child component
	- output: to pass data from child to parent component
- We can't use 2 structural directives on the same HTML element
- Module is a complete feature of your application: like user auth
- interploation isn't recommended for properties ==> use property binding instead
- two way binding = updating and displaying property in the same time

- Forms:
-- data flow wiith forms: template => class => service => database
